## What changed from the main repo?

- Custom Characters (removed from the main repo due to copyright concerns)
- Experimental features

## Quick start

### Linux / macOS

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Windows

```bat
scripts\build.bat
```

Default build output is written to `out/`.

## Build options

Use the Python tool directly for all options:

```bash
./tools/build.py src bin --help
```

Common options:

- `--debug`: include debug variants.
- `--vanilla`: include vanilla variants in addition to definitive.
- `--includes <dir>`: copy extra files into the output tree.
- `--output <dir>`: change output directory (default: `out`).
- `--clean`: remove generated caches after a successful build.
- `--xenia-path <path>`: path to Xenia executable.
- `--xenia-run {0..4}`: select which XEX to run (0 disables run).
- `--xenia-patch`: create/update Xenia patch TOML.
- `--xenia-args "..."`: extra command-line args for Xenia.

Example:

```bash
./tools/build.py src bin --vanilla --debug --xenia-path ./xenia/xenia.AppImage --xenia-run 1
```

## Helper scripts

- `scripts/flatten-gen.sh`: move `src/**/gen/*` outputs to parent directories, optionally forced and/or dry-run.
- `scripts/prune-identical-src.py`: remove `src/` files that are byte-identical to `orig/` equivalents, then prune empty directories.

Examples:

```bash
./scripts/flatten-gen.sh --dry-run
python3 scripts/prune-identical-src.py --dry-run
```

## Repository layout (high level)

- `src/`: editable mod source content.
- `obj/`: generated intermediate files.
- `out/`: final build output.
- `bin/`: base XEX binaries used by the build.
- `orig/`: reference/original game data for comparisons.
- `tools/`: core build pipeline and bundled platform tools.
- `docs/`: MkDocs documentation source.

## Documentation

Project docs are in `docs/` (MkDocs + Material):

```bash
cd docs
mkdocs serve
```

Then open the local URL shown by MkDocs.
